# NeuralNetworkPoC
PoC about Neural nets using Java's Neuroph

This PoC uses a simple DataSet to learn and predicts results for data input which are not included in the training data (aka, it's learning).

To try this, run the Neural Network Test using JUnit and compare the expected results with the predictions.
